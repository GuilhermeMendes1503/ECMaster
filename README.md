This is my current project, it is a store manager.
for now it can search for EAN and GTIN barcodes and then store them into a database.
Im also developing a mobile app that reads barcodes and sends them into the app through a TCP connection

(this program runs on an old version of the .net framework due to problems with the Html Agility Pack(i don't know the reason but it gets blocked from scraping web sites with newer frameworks but on the framework version 4.0 it works fine)
